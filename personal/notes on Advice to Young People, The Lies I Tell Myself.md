As I'm starting my sabbatical journey I am reading some posts of Jason Liu since he seems to have a career similar to something I would like to if I got into ML and LLM riding the hype wave. Furthermore I find his writing pleasant and his content could be useful even as a solopreneur. 

One of my goals for this period of time is to write more. To take more notes since I struggle memorizing without them (or even with them but at least I can read a summary later) and I want to actually *do* more. More of everything, less thinking about and more actual doing. From shipping products, to really learning and that includes writing.

Reading his post and starting now my journey, a real action would be to take notes about his post, which I found useful, at least some bits of it. Not taking notes would be less writing, less doing, less memorizing.

**Choosing**

Right now, I feel more at this point
> "This despair arises from the realization of one's absolute freedom and the responsibility for creating one's own essence and purpose."

Lately, last few years probably, I have started to realize that quote. We can go a long way by following the usual paths, at least usual to our surroundings. In my case, without major distress that turns everything upside down, it was high school, university, get a job, get married, retire. At least, that's something I (many?) thought as _given_, a fate that if didn't screw it, it would happen automatically.

And as I was applied and I did good in school, I got the first 3 steps quite easily. I never really thought of going out of that path and saw the ones doing so as outliers or with greater safety nets to fail. In some cases it could be true, in others it was probably me being short sighted, I guess it was not my fault but just lack of adult life.  

As years go by, I start questioning the meaning of what I'm doing. Is my job meaningful? Does it create value or help anyone? Corporate world feels like a charade. Despite I was working in analytics and studying and building ML models, I couldn't see if that was worth the effort and time. Once you go past the hype of learning models and cool tech bits, looking over that it feels empty. I changed jobs. Still the same, I was dreading in boredom and rat race. Needing to "impress" people or feeling that I need to be there for work 9-5 each day without feeling motivated was awful. I quit after a few months willing to take some time off. What am I doing? I have no purpose and my day to day means nothing. I like seeing my friends and family, traveling, etc but the regular life has a lot more things and time to fill. I can't make this for 30 more years.

Fortunately, tech and ML pays high salaries so I felt _safe_. I could take some time off, I can always look for other job, etc. But the feeling of "I need to do something different" was there. I started looking for other opportunities, looking for purpose in jobs, looking for motivation. I was in despair as I understood that I needed to do my own way and no one was doing it for me. 

Ironically, I took another job quit quickly because it paid much more and I could just try it, maybe I was just in the wrong place. Seems worked better, it was less of a charade, I had more time for crafting and working, I got some motivation back as I felt at least more comfortable daily. Not that I had purpose really but working was at least with less pressure. The time zone differences helped because I didn't feel like 9 hours a day I was supposed to be there, with someone 1 click away of sending a slack message to me. I stayed two years. Earning good money compared to my spending, saving and "happy". Eventually everything started to decay, the job was less free, the business request were more urgent and I quickly lost motivation and started to fall in despair again. What am I doing? Who cares about this parquet file with funny numbers?

I quit, this time for good. Despair again, realization, I need to find something for myself, or try at least. I fear for its complexity, I fear if I can do it, if I can make a living in another way. I'm taking some time to rest but I know eventually I will need to figure things out. On my own, making my own way, and I see how no one will do it for me.

As a side note, finding purpose, finding your way, etc was also a thing when I thought about romantic relationships. Finding someone that you really care about and that cares about you is not easy at all and it doesn't happen magically as I thought as a kid. I am not going to expand about it here but it was another topic that made me realize about our own fate and efforts.

Side side note, retirement is another one. I don't see my national retirement plan as something you can live off. I see my family, that luckily does well but despite that nothing is granted and we can support the elder in my family because our own safety net. A younger me didn't know that but as my twenties went by I started to see a lot more of adult/real life. Eye opening period of my life.

**How to be lucky**

"Okay, I'm focused on getting X, but let's not forget to read the headlines."

**High Agency and be the plumber**

Reminder to myself, focus on bringing solutions and not the shiny new tool. I think I'm good at high agency or at being responsible and wanting to finish what I commit to.  
I need to work on focusing on which solution am I bringing. Finding the right niche and actually bringing value.
In my case with sportsjobs.online, not just throwing things into it, but making it clear what I am providing.
For other topics related to ML and LLM I need to decide what I'll focus on this time coming in.

**Impostor Syndrome**
I'm the classical example of not trusting myself  and thinking stuff like this.
 > ), but at the end of the day, you must just think I have shit taste and that you've somehow tricked me into thinking you're good when you're an impostor? Right?

I need to stop with that. Quitting now I had plenty of nice words for every colleague, including the desire from managers that I stay or I come back if I get bored of not having a job. Of course, as I write that, I think in the back of my mind of exceptions and that technical colleagues were less effusive as my managers and etc. but all of that is probably not true. I'm going against all evidence and just guessing and making things in my head.

**How to Be Good at Many Things**
Consistency. Every one says this. I need to do it the right way now that I'll have the time. No excuses.

Do things, practice, keep going for it. Everything will be easier and quicker.

And I need to be grateful for what I have and how lucky I am to be able to get a sabbatical time to try to change the path I'm going.


**Write more**
Just quoting:
>It wasn't until November 2023 that I truly appreciated the power of writing. Writing helps me stop dwelling on the same thoughts repeatedly. Moreover, when someone asks for advice, I can simply share a link instead of repeating myself. I have found writing to be incredibly valuable because if someone is not willing to read it, they won't benefit from it. The worst outcome is not having written anything at all; it is failing to help someone who could have benefited from it. I have found that writing is a great way to help others while helping myself exorcise the thoughts from my mind and make room for new ones.
