**NBA predictions and betting**
I have developed a bayesian model using PYMC3 to predict a distribution of points scored per player in NBA matches and ultimately predicting the match result as a sum of those distributions. Simulating thousands of realizations of those distributions I end up with probabilities of winning for both teams in a match.
Using a bookmaker API I get the daily odds of each match and automatically place a bet if the odds paid are better than the minimum my model expects to be profitable in the long run. 
The project was profitable over a few hundred matches for the 2022-2023 season. For 2023-2024 it started with poor results and I paused it as I didn't have the time to work on it with my full time job.

**Arbitrage in sports betting**
My final work for the university was about arbitrage in sports betting and how to profit from differences in the odds offered by different bookmakers. I wrote about the mathematics behind it and how to find these opportunities. I actually bet myself on those opportunities and made a profit until I faced limitations by the bookmaker sites.

**Poker**
I'm familiar with poker at a competitive level. Many years ago I used to play online trying to climb the ladder following a mathematical approach and statistics about the opponents. I didn't pursue that path as I was younger but I always remained interested in the field.
