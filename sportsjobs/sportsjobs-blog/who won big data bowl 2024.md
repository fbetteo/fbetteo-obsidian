## Winner Analysis of the Big Data Bowl 2024

###  Top 8  comments and insights from the winning team.

* Missed Tackle Opportunities represents a new class of defensive mistake that is not captured by current football statistics.
* For this analysis they had access to approximately 12000 plays from the first 9 weeks of the season.
* A missed tackle opportunity is each time a defender had the chance to tackle down the ball carrier but was unsuccessful. Maybe he didn't even try but he had the chance.
* Using tracking data and some generated features they created a model to predict for each play the probability each defender would tackle the ball carrier in the next second.
* If a player has at least 75% for more than 0.5 seconds and doesn't capitalize that tackle, dropping the its probabilities below %75 in the future for more than 0.5 seconds, they label that as misses tackle opportunity.
* They found about 4 times more missed tackle opportunities compared to the NFL tracked ones.
* They found some (not large) correlation between missed opportunities by team and their win rate
* They ranked defenders and runners based on this new metric. How many tackle opportunities the defendants generate for themselves.
