Some thoughts on why simulate.

### Understand the model
5.4.1 Advanced data analysis from an elementary point of view. Apartado corto, no terminÃ© de entender.

### Checking the model

Once we have a model, simulation from it should look like real data or more exactly, real data should look like a typical realization of the model. If not, there is a systematic error. We can learn a lot how the model breaks down and how to improved.

>"A useful principle for model checking is that if we do some exploratory data analyses of the real data, doing the same analyses to realizations of the model should give roughly the same results"

#### Sensitivity analysis

Checking how sensitive our inferences are to the assumptions.  Like create models where the assumptions are violated but analyzing them as though the assumptions held and seeing how badly wrong we go.
We hope inference are not too messed up in different scenarios but if they do we should be very cautious in our inferences.
